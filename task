Create fully tested simple functions to perform the following operations.

1.	Add two numbers
2.	Add an indefinite amount of numbers
3.	Takes two numbers as argument and return the difference between the numbers
4.	Multiply an indefinite amount of arguments
5.	Takes two numbers as arguments and returns the first number divided by the second number.
6.	Takes a username as an argument and makes a call to GitHub API and returns all the repositories owned by the user as an array.
7.	Takes two strings as arguments and return the concatenation of the two strings.

NOTE: Your test should account for all possible edge cases. Also, make sure that all tests are failing before actual implementation.
